# imagenary_time_wavefunction_collapse_simulation
Entropy-Driven Wavefunction Collapse (Imaginary Time) Simulates deterministic wavefunction collapse via entropy minimization in imaginary time. Implements variational dynamics, tracks norm, energy, and entropy, and visualizes localization over time.
